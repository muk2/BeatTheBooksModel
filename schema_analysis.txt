Used /d tablename for each table in the db + /di for the all of the indexes as well and put it in copilot for analysis:

⚡ Next Steps for Analysis
Relationships: Right now, no explicit foreign keys are defined. If you want relational integrity:

coaches.team_abbr ↔ team_standings.team_name (or abbreviation if normalized).

players could link to team_games or team_standings via team reference.

Documentation: You can export the schema with:

pg_dump --schema-only -d your_db > schema.sql
That gives you a reproducible snapshot for your repo.

Visualization: Tools like pgAdmin or schemaspy can generate ER diagrams automatically.
